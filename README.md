# YG-tools

A collection of Python 3.x scripts to process Yahoo! Group data in JSON, originally scraped using tools like <a href="https://github.com/TransGeekMovie/Yahoo-Groups-Archivers-w-cookie-support">Yahoo-Groups-Archivers-w-cookie-support</a>. Currently, none of these require any additional dependencies. More scripts may be added in the future, depending on user or community need.

* <b>threadparser.py</b> - Parses Yahoo! Group messages originally in JSON into e-mail readable format. Each thread is its own indivdiual .txt file, entitled with its original Thread ID number and subject. It includes the option to redact identifying information in the header, such as From, To, CC, etc. While redaction cannot fully anonymize files, it does offer some privacy and limits how the files could be used to large-scale analysis. For simplicity's sake, script looks for JSON files within the folder it's in, so it should be placed with them - unlike Usenet, message and thread IDs are not unique identifiers, so only a single group can be processed at a time. The output of this script was primarily designed for human readability and preservation, though it could be easily modified to output files into a mailbox format for import elsewhere.
